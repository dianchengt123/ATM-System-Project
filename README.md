This program is a final project I created for my Python class. It's a console-based user interface that simulates the function of an atm machine.

The basic functions include: allowing the user to create a pin, change that pin, check their balance, withdraw money, and deposit money. 
This project helped me practice concepts related to Object-Orientated Programming, such as classes, objects, methods, and data encapsulation.
